Single Point System:
    • Each stop is identified only by the star name. Trading post is assumed just by stopping there. Only one post per system. Simple, easy to setup.
Multi-Point System:
    • Each stop is identified by the star name, but there are multiple trading posts per system. More complex, would need to delve into an expanded view. Larger number of objects to keep track of.
